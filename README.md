# flutt_infosheet  
This is an animated "information sheet," sort of like a powerpoint slide, for Flutter apps.

## DETAILS
I made this small project so I have a repo for a re-usable "information sheet" for various projects.  It uses one package -- "flutter_animate" -- in order to give the "sheets" some sizzle.  



## NOTES
See [NOTES.md](https://github.com/mattgwriter7/flutt_infosheet/blob/main/NOTES.md)  for more detailed notes, including where I am at with this project, and future plans.
