# flutt_infosheet (version 1.0.alpha.3)
This is an attractive UI for an Information Screen.  It has a background design (on top, and on bottom), information text with stylized fonts, and a button with an icon and text underneath.

## DESCRIPTION
README.md is a general info, NOTES.md is for longer stuff.

## LEFT OFF
* made 2 different "sheets" that switch each time you go to Info_Page

## NEXT
* tweak fonts 
  + use better Google font for headline
  + improve color (and use differen color for each sheet)
* research animation effects

## CONSIDERATIONS
I am considering:
* refactor InfoSheet() 
  + should I just call it Sheet() ?
  + make Constructor load default sheet
* add G Skinner animation package?
* add Girl Sprite to bottom right corner
  + thumbs up 
  + fist pump  ("Hurray!")
  + defeated (arms balled at side, slumped shoulders) 
  + "What gives?" (open palms)
  + "Doh!" (palms pressed on forehead)
  + DREAM: Have these animated!!!
