# flutt_infosheet (version 1.0.alpha.2)
This is an attractive UI for an Information Screen.  It has a background design (on top, and on bottom), information text with stylized fonts, and a button with an icon and text underneath.

## DESCRIPTION
README.md is a general info, NOTES.md is for longer stuff.

## LEFT OFF
* added tringular images (seprated)

## NEXT
* add fancy font (from Google fonts)
* resarch animation effects

## CONSIDERATIONS
I am cosidering:
* Should Info_Page be a re-usable page, that uses a helper class: InfoSheet()
  + with all of the different sheets ready-to-go
  + and then just pass an Int or ENUM to Info_Page() which
    will customize that particular page?
* Should I add the G Skinner animation package?
